## Description
- Motivation: My motivation in making this way to refactor a web app to utilize GraphQL
- Why: I built this application to further my understanding of using technologies in the MERN stack together
- What problem does this solve: This implementation allows you to look at portions of your data set based off a query, saving processing power
- What I learned: I learned how difficult it is to refactor something like for like with a new technology.
- Challanges: Determining what code no longer is needed and what exactly needs to change to work with the new technology was challenging.
